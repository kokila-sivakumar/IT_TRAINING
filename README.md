## PROGRAM - REVERSE
Write a program to check whether a number is equal to the reverse of the same number. 123 = 321 PASS 456 = 134 FAIL Sounds easy right? Hereâ€™s the catch: The number should not be converted to string.

## OUTPUT
Reverse of the given number is 121,  
Value of n is 121  
YES

(If n value is 234) 
Reverse of the given number is 432,     
Value of n is 234  
NO

(If n value is 0)
Reverse of the given number is 0,  
Value of n is 0  
YES


## PROGRAM - PALINDROME
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.
## OUTPUT
Enter the number:121   
Reverse of the number is:121  
true

Enter the number:456   
Reverse of the number is:654  
false

## PROGRAM - TWO STRING
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.
## OUTPUT 
nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
[0,1]
